                <h2>How it Started</h2>

                <p>It all began in the summer of 2011. It was a bright and
glorious summer. Everyone was young. <em>Firework</em> was playing. The water
was luke. The pool was calling. We took to the air, and got caught in the
moment.</p>
                <p>What started as a facebook album quickly became an internet
sensation. So we started this site, and soon people all around the world were
diving in.</p>
                <p>So every summer, we post the best dives for the world to
see. Why? Well, because life is a little too short and a lot too serious and
when the sun is shining, people should be lounging and laughing.</p>
                <p>Which brings us to..</p>

                <h2>How to Leisure Dive</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Grab some friends, a decent camera, and head
                    somewhere chill near a body of water. A swimming pool
                    works. A lake will do. A river? You crazy.</li>
                    <li>Put on a bathing suit. Or a linen suit. Or a koala
                    suit. Anything leisurely.</li>
                    <li>Grab something that says you are just a chilled out
                    individual. A piña colada. A pitching wedge. A harpsichord.
                    Whatever. We all unwind differently.</li>
                    <li>Find a nice perch from which to jump. Make sure you
                    have a leisurely backdrop and a safe landing.</li>
                    <li>Now jump in, and embrace the leisure. Tip your glass.
                    Pop your elbow. And most importantly, look at the camera
                    with a face that says, “Does this suit make me look
                    awesome?” The answer is yes. And, <em>SNAP.</em></li>
                </ol>
                <h3>You’ve got your very own Leisure Dive.</h3>
                <p>It doesn’t always turn out perfect, but when it does, trust
                us: It feels like angels singing Journey on a double rainbow
                made of dreams.</p>
                <p>That’s it. You’re ready to dive in. Peruse the site for
                inspiration, hit the pool, and post your best shots on
                Instagram and tag us <em>@leisuredive</em> and
                <em>#leisuredive</em></p>
                <p>Most of all, have fun with it. Because it’s summer,
                friends.</p>
                <h3>And leisure is in the air..</h3>
